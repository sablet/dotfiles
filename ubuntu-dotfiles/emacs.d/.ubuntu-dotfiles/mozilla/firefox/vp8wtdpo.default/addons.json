Convert tabs to a list and reduce browser memory","fullDescription":"Whenever you find yourself with too many tabs, click the OneTab icon to convert all of your tabs into a list. When you need to access the tabs again, you can either restore them individually or all at once.\n\nWhen your tabs are in the OneTab list, you will save memory and CPU utilization because you will have reduced the number of tabs open in your browser.\n\nPrivacy assurance\n\nInformation about your tabs are never transmitted or disclosed to either the OneTab developers or any other party. The only exception to this is if you intentionally click on our 'share as a web page' feature that allows you to upload your list of tabs into a web page in order to share them with others. Tabs are never shared unless you specifically use the 'share as a web page' button. We use Google's favicon generator to retrieve favicons for each domain in your list, but only the domain name is used and the full URL is never disclosed.\n\nAdditional Benefits\n\nDepending on how many scripts are running inside your tabs, moving them to OneTab can also speed up your computer by reducing the CPU load. We have also had reports that this also contributes to your computer resuming from sleep more quickly.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use my browser history?\nA: Your browser history contains every site you've ever visited. OneTab is typically used to store just the smaller selection of open tabs you are not finished with yet - such as when you are mid way through researching a topic.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use the \"bookmark all tabs\" browser feature?\nA: OneTab is the quickest way, with only one click, to store all of your open tabs into a list. Once they are in your list, OneTab makes it much easier to scan over, delete, label and manage your list of saved tabs. There are also plenty of special options and features, such as the ability to exclude certain web sites, to remove duplicates, and to export/import tabs.\n\nCompatibility: This add-on has been thoroughly tested with the latest versions of Firefox. If the OneTab tab fails to load, this could also be because you have another third party add-on which is conflicting with OneTab. In particular, there are some third party add-ons that block javascript from loading, or that customize the right click menu options and prevent the OneTab right click menu from appearing.\n\nIMPORTANT JUNE 2016 UPDATE:\nWe've just released a new version of OneTab with a completely rewritten storage engine. This is designed to fix the long standing bug, where under certain circumstances such as a browser crash or a lack of disk space, Firefox sometimes wiped clean the JSON storage which contained your tabs. Now we're using IndexedDB which is designed to be vastly superior and which has safeguards for data resilience. Please note that if you were previously manually backing up your tabs by copying the 'json' storage file, this will no longer reflect the current state of your tabs, so instead we recommend you use the 'Export' mechanism built into the OneTab addon or alternatively ensure you have online or other backup which will back up your Firefox profile directory.\n\nIMPORTANT: Firefox 'Refresh' will remove all of your add-ons\nSometimes, Firefox will display a message in your browser asking if you'd like to \"Refresh Firefox\". This sounds like it's a normal Firefox update, but it is not. It warns you that it will delete all of the addons in your browser, but most people click so fast through the Firefox warnings that they don't realise how dangerous this feature is.

Also: scroll wheel navigation, page scrolling, tab scrolling.","fullDescription":"Mouse Gestures for Seamonkey & Firefox\n\nMouse Gestures Suite is based on (abandoned) Firefox extension All-in-One Gestures and has been modified to work with Seamonkey and later also with Firefox (since ver. 1.5.0). Many fixes and improvements have been made and new features added.\n\nMain features:\n\nMouse gestures - performed by moving the mouse with a button depressed allow you to quickly navigate through pages, open/close tabs and windows and perform many other commands without having to use toolbar buttons, menus or keyboard shortcuts. A gesture consists of a series of mouse movements in one of 4 directions (up, down, left, right).\n\nRocker gestures - invoked by pressing one mouse button and then the other while keeping the first one pressed. By default used to go back and forward in browsing history but can be customized to do something else.\n\nScroll wheel in tab bar - you can switch between tabs by scrolling mouse wheel over the tab bar.\n\nScroll wheel navigation - perform your favourite actions by pressing a mouse button and scrolling mouse wheel at the same time.\n\nMiddle button scrolling - auto scroll pages or textareas by clicking the middle mouse button once (pressing and releasing) and then control the scrolling speed by moving the mouse or using arrow keys. Grab and Drag options allow you to scroll by moving the mouse while the middle button is depressed.\n\nLink tooltip - see details about links as you hover over them with your mouse. Useful especially for browsing without the status bar like in full screen mode.\n\nAll the above features work in the Browser component. Mouse and rocker gestures also work in Mail, Message, Mail Compose and View Page Source windows — the gesture movements are the same as those in Browser, however not all actions work in those other window types since not all of them are applicable there — see help for detailed information.\n\nCustom functions are supported: you can easily use mouse gestures to invoke any main menu item action (under File, Edit, View, etc.) or any custom script you write.\n\nIf you have any other mouse gestures extensions they may conflict with each other so please disable or uninstall them before trying out this one.\n\nFull documentation is available here.\n\nVersions 1.7.0 and later are compatible with multi-process Firefox (e10s).

The aim is to restore the users right of anonymity in the web. Most websites monitor the behaviour of their users, giving the websites hosts the ability to analyze the general users behaviour and create detailed user profiles, which are frequently sold to third parties.\nA threat for freedom of speech on the internet manifests in the repression through federal or private organizations. More and more governments censor websites with the excuse of child safety, copyright infringement or the fight against terrorism and thereby limit the freedom of speech.\nAlso blocking users based on their origin with GeoIP-Blocks is applied often, for example at media platforms like YouTube.\n\nanonymoX enables you to...\n\n    Browse the web anonymously\n    Change your IP address (to one provided by us)\n    Visit blocked/censored websites\n    Appear to originate from another country\n    Delete cookies, show your public ip, change browser id, ....\n\n\nShort summary of its functionality\nInstead of accessing a website directly, it will be first opened by one of our servers, called a Proxy.\nThis Proxy hides your true internet identity and makes it look as if not you, but the Proxy is currently visiting the website.\n\nanonymoX is more than just an Add-On.

Record and replay repetitive tasks. If you're tired of manually visiting the same sites, filling out forms, downloading files and extracting data, then iMacros is for you! Save time, effort and money with iMacros browser automation!","fullDescription":"iMacros was designed to automate the most repetitive tasks on the web. If there’s an activity you have to do repeatedly, just record it in iMacros. The next time you need to do it, the entire macro will run at the click of a button! With iMacros, you can quickly and easily fill out web forms, remember passwords, create a webmail notifier, download files from other sites, scrape the Web (extract data from multiple sites), and more. You can keep the macros on your computer for your own use, or share them with others by embedding them on your homepage, blog, company intranet or any social bookmarking service. The uses are limited only by your imagination!\n\nHere are just a few examples of how you can use iMacros to automate your web browser.\n\n(1) Form Filler & Password Manager\n\nWith iMacros for Firefox, you no longer need to check the same sites every day, remembering passwords, and filling out web forms. iMacros is the only form filler that can autofill web forms that stretch over several pages. All information is stored in human-readable, plain text files that can be easily edited. Passwords are stored securely with 256-Bit encryption. Users memorize only one master password and iMacros remembers all the others, providing a truly automated login and form filling experience.\n\n(2) Automated Download & Upload\n\niMacros can automate the download of images, files, or entire pages (with or without images). In the other direction, it can automate the upload of data to websites. You can use variables inside the macros and import data from CSV files. iMacros includes a user agent switcher as well as image blocking functions. When combined and controlled with Javascript, the recorded macros can script even very complex tasks.\n\n(3) Data Extraction, Web Scraping/Mining & Enterprise Data Mash-Ups\n\nThe iMacros EXTRACT command automatically reads data from a website and exports it to CSV files – the exact opposite of filling out forms. iMacros includes full Unicode support and works with every language, including multi-byte languages such as Chinese. You can use this feature to download stock quotes, gather and compare web store prices, and more.\n\n(4) Web Testing\n\nWeb professionals can use iMacros for functional, performance, and regression testing of web applications. The built-in STOPWATCH command captures precise web page response times. iMacros also includes support for many AJAX elements.\n\n(5) Social Scripting (Bookmarklets)\n\nSharing your favorite iMacros with friends and colleagues is easy. Simply right-click the macro to add it as a bookmark, or select \"Run Everywhere\" and embed the complete macro in a simple link.
